### 4. The fix loop

The loop triggers when the review reports spec ❌, any Critical or Important
finding, or a ⚠️ item you confirmed as a real gap.

Before the loop starts, two routes leave it immediately:

- Record Minor findings in the progress ledger as you go
  (`Task <N>: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`), and point the final
  whole-branch review at that list so it can triage which must be fixed
  before merge. A roll-up nobody reads is a silent discard. Minor findings
  never enter the loop.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with
  what the plan's text requires — is yours to rule on: weigh the finding
  against the plan text, decide with the spec as the binding authority, and
  ledger the ruling before you act on it. Do not dismiss the finding because
  the plan mandates it, and do not dispatch a fix that contradicts the plan
  without a recorded ruling.
Everything else enters the loop. A fix round is one fix dispatch plus one
scoped re-review. Five rounds maximum per task:

**Rounds 1-3 — resume the original implementer.** Send it the open findings
verbatim. Its context is intact: it knows the task, the code, and its own
choices. If your harness cannot send another message to a live subagent,
dispatch a fresh implementer carrying the brief path, the report-file path,
and the findings — the report file is the persistent memory either way.

**Rounds 4-5 — dispatch a fresh implementer on a more capable model** (per
Model Selection), with the brief path, the report-file path, the open
findings, and this framing: "A prior implementer attempted this task
[N] times; you own it now. Read the report file for what was tried." A loop
that survives three resumes usually means the implementer cannot see its
own problem — fresh eyes and a capability bump in one move.

**Every round, either way:** the implementer fixes, re-runs the tests
covering the amended code, appends its fix report to the same report file,
and returns the short contract. Before re-dispatching the reviewer, confirm
the fix report contains the covering tests, the command run, and the
output; dispatch the re-review once all three are present. Name the
covering test files in the fix message — a one-line fix does not need the
whole suite.

**The re-review is scoped.** Run `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD`
where FIX_BASE is the head the previous review saw, and dispatch
[re-review-prompt.md](re-review-prompt.md) with the findings list, the
brief, the report file, and the printed diff path. The re-reviewer verdicts
each finding ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED and flags new breakage in the fix
diff only. New Critical/Important breakage in the fix diff joins the open
findings list. Out-of-scope observations go to the ledger as deferred
minors — they never extend the loop.

**After each round,** append to the ledger:
`Task <N>: fix round <R>/5 (<X> addressed, <Y> open — <finding one-liners>; commits <a7>..<b7>)`

Never fix findings yourself in the controller session — your context stays
clean for coordination, and controller fixes skip review.

**The breaker.** When round 5's re-review still leaves findings open, stop
dispatching. Adjudicate each open finding yourself — you hold the plan and
the cross-task context the reviewer lacks:

- **The reviewer is wrong, or the point is contestable:** park it —
  `Task <N>: parked — <finding> — Ruling: <why the code stands>`. The final
  review sees both sides.
- **Real, but nothing downstream builds on it:** park it the same way, with
  a ruling that says it's real and deferred.
- **Real and load-bearing** — a later task builds on it, or it reveals a
  plan defect: rule on the smallest change that unblocks the dependent work,
  ledger it as `Task <N>: Ruling: <finding> — <what you decided and why>`,
  and carry it into the next task's dispatch. Parking a structural failure
  silently lets every dependent task build on it. Stop only when the defect
  leaves every path forward a guess.

Adjudicate only at the cap. Adjudicating earlier to end a loop is
pre-judging with a different name. Every adjudication is a ledger entry —
a silent discard is forbidden.

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Setup: worktree verified]
[Read plan file once: docs/superpowers/plans/feature-plan.md]
[Resolve workspace: scripts/sdd-workspace docs/superpowers/plans/feature-plan.md — no ledger inside, fresh start]
[Create todos for all tasks]

Task 1: Hook installation script

[Run task-brief for Task 1; dispatch implementer with brief + report paths + context]

Implementer: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.config/superpowers/hooks/)"

Implementer: [Later]
  - Implemented install-hook command
  - Added tests, 5/5 passing
  - Self-review: Found I missed --force flag, added it
  - Committed

[Run review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD; dispatch task reviewer with the printed path]
Task reviewer: Spec ✅ - all requirements met, nothing extra.
  Strengths: Good test coverage, clean. Issues: None. Task quality: Approved.

[Ledger: Task 1: complete (commits a1b2c3d..d4e5f6a, review clean)]

Task 2: Recovery modes

[Run task-brief for Task 2; dispatch implementer with brief + report paths + context]

Implementer: [No questions]
  - Added verify/repair modes
  - 8/8 tests passing
  - Committed

[Run review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD; dispatch task reviewer with the printed path]
Task reviewer: Spec ❌:
  - Missing: Progress reporting (spec says "report every 100 items")
  Issues (Important): Magic number (100)

[Fix round 1: resume the implementer with both findings]
Implementer: Added progress reporting, extracted PROGRESS_INTERVAL constant.
  Re-ran test/recovery.test.js — 10/10 passing. Fix report appended.

[Run review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD; dispatch scoped re-review]
Re-reviewer: Missing progress reporting — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:41).
  Magic number — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:7). New breakage: none.
  Verdict: all findings addressed.

[Ledger: Task 2: fix round 1/5 (2 addressed, 0 open; commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e)]
[Ledger: Task 2: complete (commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e, review clean)]

...

[After all tasks]
[Run review-package PLAN_FILE MERGE_BASE HEAD; dispatch final code-reviewer, most capable model]
Final reviewer: All requirements met. Deferred minors triaged: none block merge.

[Delete this plan's workspace — the record now lives in git]

Done! Using superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch.
