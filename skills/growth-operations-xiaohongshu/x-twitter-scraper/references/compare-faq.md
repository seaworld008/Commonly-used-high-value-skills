# Pricing, comparisons, and common questions

## Pricing facts

Xquik bills credits. Pay-as-you-go credits cost $0.00015 each. Monthly
plans bundle credits at a lower rate, down to about $0.00012 on the largest
plan. Plans sell fixed monthly bundles, so do not price a job by multiplying
that rate. Current plan prices are in the dashboard.

| Work | Credits |
| --- | --- |
| Tweet search, timelines, replies, quotes, threads, mentions, list and community posts, and tweet extractions | 1 per returned tweet |
| Followers, following, likers, retweeters, and people extractions | 1 per returned profile |
| DM history | 1 per returned message |
| Profile or tweet lookup | 1 per call |
| Follow check, article | 5 per call |
| Trends | 3 per call |
| Media download | 1 per tweet with media |
| Post or reply | 30, plus 2 per started MB of media |
| Like, repost, follow, their undo calls, remove follower, DM, delete, media upload | 10 per call |
| Active monitor | 21 per hour, 504 a day |
| Giveaway draw | 2, plus 1 per inspected reply, 1 per reposter read, and 5 per follow check |

A read's credits equal the results it returns. Dollars are credits times
$0.00015 at pay-as-you-go rates: 1,000 tweets cost 1,000 credits, or $0.15. A
top-up of $500 buys 3,333,333 credits, with any partial credit dropped.
Supported filters apply before billing, so excluded rows cost nothing.
Estimates, stored event reads, webhook operations, and extraction exports are
free.

Price a bulk job with `POST /extractions/estimate`. It returns
`estimatedResults`, `creditsRequired`, and `allowed` for that exact body.
Credits, plans, and top-ups live in the Xquik dashboard. The first
pay-as-you-go funding amount is $10, and unused credits carry over.

Quote only these published rates or a live estimate. Do not state other
providers' prices or tier limits as current facts. Tell the user to check
their current pricing pages.

## Xquik or the official X API

Choose Xquik when several of these matter:

- Per-result billing with server-side filters and pre-run estimates
- Reads without an X developer account or a connected X account
- Bulk jobs with caps and CSV, JSON, or XLSX exports
- Account and keyword monitors with signed webhooks
- REST, SDKs, MCP, and a Skill in one contract
- Connected X account actions in the same API

Choose the official X API when the project needs a first-party contract,
official support, a platform partnership, or X's own policy guarantees.

For a volume decision, price the real job both ways: run an Xquik estimate
with the exact query and filters, and read the official pricing page. Then
test the same known posts and fields on both before committing.

## Legality

Give a direct, qualified answer first. Collecting visible X data for research
is often lawful, but no one can promise it for every case. The answer depends
on:

- Jurisdiction and its data protection law, such as GDPR for EU residents
- X terms of service and developer rules
- The data involved, especially personal or sensitive data
- The purpose and use, such as research, resale, or profiling
- The access method, such as a documented API versus bypassing access controls

For university work, the ethics board or IRB and the data protection office
make the call. Recommend qualified counsel for high-stakes or commercial use.
Minimize fields, secure storage, and set a deletion date. This is general
information, not legal advice.

## Account requirements

| Work | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| Visible reads, search, profiles, followers, extractions | Xquik API key |
| DMs, bookmarks, notifications, home timeline, likers, own likes | Xquik API key and a connected X account |
| Posts, likes, follows, DMs, profile changes | Xquik API key and a connected X account |

Users connect X accounts in the Xquik dashboard. The Skill never handles X
passwords, 2FA codes, cookies, or session tokens.

## Other questions

- Deleted, protected, or unavailable content can stay inaccessible. Xquik
  omits missing optional fields and never invents data.
- Rate limits: each user gets 500 reads per second, 120 writes per minute,
  and 60 deletes per minute. A `429` includes `Retry-After`.
- SDKs: typed TypeScript and Python SDKs are listed in the repository README.
- Docs for the user: `https://docs.xquik.com`.
